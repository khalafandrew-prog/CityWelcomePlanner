Action-Oriented UX: Quick access to key hubs (Transport, Attractions, Essentials) via prominent icons.

Professional Branding: Uses the established Navy Blue color (R: 0, G: 35, B: 102) for a clean, trustworthy look.

Real-time Readiness: Provides immediate links and contact information, essential for travelers.
